# Data Science Portfolio
This repository showcases my data science portfolio, featuring projects completed for academic purposes, self-learning, and personal hobbies. It highlights a variety of topics and techniques, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, while reflecting my passion for exploring diverse challenges in the field.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1.	Install all necessary dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.	Open the notebooks using your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or an IDE like VS Code.
3.	Run the cells as needed to execute the code.

## Contents
- ### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Projects
This section features projects focused on transforming raw data into a clean, usable format suitable for analysis and modeling. It includes processes like handling missing values, identifying and treating outliers, standardizing data types, and structuring data for optimal performance. These projects highlight the critical importance of ensuring data reliability and quality.

- ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects
Projects in this section involve summarizing the main characteristics of datasets and using visualizations to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies. EDA is crucial for gaining deep insights into data before modeling and helps in formulating hypotheses.

- ### Machine Learning Models Projects
This category includes projects dedicated to developing and implementing algorithms that learn from past data to predict future outcomes or make decisions. It covers building and evaluating models using techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering to solve real-world problems.

- ### Deep Learning Projects
This section focuses on projects that utilize artificial neural networks to learn complex patterns and hierarchical feature representations. It includes work involving advanced neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) applied to areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

- ### A/B Testing or Statistical Analysis Projects
Projects in this section involve designing experiments, conducting hypothesis testing, and applying statistical inference methods to evaluate specific assumptions or the impact of product features. A/B testing projects demonstrate an understanding of statistical significance and confidence intervals to draw meaningful conclusions and guide business decisions.

- ### Deployment/Application Projects
This category highlights projects where developed models or analyses are integrated into real-world applications. This could involve deploying a machine learning model as a web application, making it accessible via an API, or building interactive dashboards. These projects showcase the ability to bring a data science product from development to production.
