# Data Science Portfolio
This repository showcases my data science portfolio, featuring projects completed for academic purposes, self-learning, and personal hobbies. It highlights a variety of topics and techniques, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, while reflecting my passion for exploring diverse challenges in the field.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1.	Install all necessary dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.	Open the notebooks using your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or an IDE like VS Code.
3.	Run the cells as needed to execute the code.

## Contents
- ### Machine Learning
    - [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Boston%20Housing%20Prices/Predicting_Boston_Housing_Prices.ipynb): This project is an analytical study that utilizes data science and machine learning methods to predict housing prices in Boston. Factors influencing housing prices were examined, followed by data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of predictive models to derive results. This study aims to enhance the understanding of both data science techniques and the dynamics of the real estate market.
    - [Diet, Exercise, and PCOS Insights Prediction](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Diet%2C%20Exercise%2C%20and%20PCOS%20Insights%20Prediction): This project is an analytical study that leverages data science and machine learning methods to predict and analyze the relationship between diet, exercise, and the symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Key factors influencing PCOS symptoms were examined, followed by data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models to uncover insights. The aim of this study is to deepen the understanding of PCOS management through lifestyle factors while demonstrating the application of data science techniques in healthcare research.

    _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
    - #### Python 
        - [Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Titanic%20Dataset%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/Titanic_Dataset_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb): This project involves a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the passengers onboard the RMS Titanic, focusing on their demographic, socioeconomic, and survival characteristics. Using Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis, combined with the powerful visualization capabilities of Seaborn, the study aims to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights about the passengers and factors influencing survival during the tragic maritime disaster.
        - [Diet, Exercise, and PCOS Insights Data Analysis](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Diet%2C%20Exercise%2C%20and%20PCOS%20Insights%20Data%20Analysis/Diet%2C_Exercise%2C_and_PCOS_Insights_Data_Analysis.ipynb): This project explores a comprehensive analysis of data related to diet, exercise, and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), focusing on how these factors interact and impact the health and well-being of individuals with PCOS. Using Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis, along with Seaborn’s powerful visualization tools, the study aims to identify patterns, trends, and key insights on the relationship between lifestyle choices and PCOS management. The goal is to uncover actionable findings that can guide better understanding and potential interventions for those affected by PCOS.
